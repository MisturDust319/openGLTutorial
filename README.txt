A project I'm doing to learn about OpenGL following this tutorial series:
https://youtu.be/ftiKrP3gW3k?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXT9T-hD0Bj31DSnwio-ywh

Uses GLEW-1.13.0, GLM, and SDL-2.0.4

Things I've noticed:
I tried using the 64bit libraries, but they didn't work. It seem to be a
problem with the Windows 64bit OpenGL library itself, but I'm not sure.
It was also my first attempt at making a 64 bit application, so it seemed best to
keep it at one problem at a time, and since it is just a test, I just went back to
using the 32bit libraries.
